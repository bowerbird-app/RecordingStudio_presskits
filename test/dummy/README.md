# Dummy host

This Rails app exists to prove Recording Studio Press Kits in a real host. It is not the product.

## What It Covers

- Devise authentication with a seeded admin user
- `Current.actor` wiring for Recording Studio events
- Root workspace plus a seeded press kit and host-only fake section
- Authenticated home on Recording Studio's default layout, with FlatPack assets, showing that seeded outline
- Mounted `RecordingStudio::Engine` route behavior inside a host app

## Quick Start

```bash
cd test/dummy
bundle install
bin/rails db:setup
bin/dev
```

Run the commands above from the dummy app directory, not the repository root.

Then open the app and sign in with:

- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Password: `Password`

## Useful Routes

- `/` - dummy host home page (default layout plus the seeded workspace outline)
- `/recording_studio` - redirects to `/` while the mounted Recording Studio engine stays available under that prefix for non-root routes
- `/users/sign_in` - Devise sign-in page
- `/up` - Rails health check

## Why This App Exists

Use this app to verify press kits boot in a host. If a layout, route, asset source, or Recording Studio initializer change breaks here, the gem likely needs adjustment before reuse.

Authenticated pages use Recording Studio's shared default layout. Devise sign-in keeps `layouts/application`.

Dummy Tailwind must scan FlatPack components and Recording Studio's default layout, or the host looks unstyled. `bin/rails tailwindcss:build` writes gem `@source` paths first. After changing views or gems, run that build (or `bin/dev`) so CSS is not an empty shell.
