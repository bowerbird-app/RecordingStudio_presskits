# Dummy host

This Rails app exists to prove Recording Studio Press Kits in a real host. It is not the product.

## What It Covers

- Devise authentication with a seeded admin user
- `Current.actor` wiring for Recording Studio events
- Root workspace plus a seeded press kit and two host-only fake sections
- Orderable, Trashable, and Duplicatable install, migrations, and mounts
- Recording Studio Admin 2.0 mounted under an admin root, with Accessible grants for the seeded admin
- Authenticated `/` redirects to the press kit index on Recording Studio's default layout
- Cards and table views of kits, plus a kit page that adds, removes, and reorders FakeBlock children
- Mounted `RecordingStudio::Engine` route behavior inside a host app

## Quick Start

```bash
cd test/dummy
bundle install
bin/rails db:setup
bin/dev
```

Run the commands above from the dummy app directory, not the repository root.

Then open the app and sign in with:

- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Password: `Password`

## Useful Routes

- `/` - redirects to the press kit index
- `/recording_studio_presskits` - press kit index (cards or table)
- `/admin` - Admin press kits list
- `/recording_studio` - redirects to the press kit index while the mounted Recording Studio engine stays available under that prefix for non-root routes
- `/recording_studio_orderable` - Orderable engine mount from its install generator
- `/recording_studio_trashable` - Trashable engine mount from its install generator
- `/recording_studio_duplicatable` - Duplicatable engine mount from its install generator
- `/users/sign_in` - Devise sign-in page
- `/up` - Rails health check

## Why This App Exists

Use this app to verify press kits boot in a host. If a layout, route, asset source, or Recording Studio initializer change breaks here, the gem likely needs adjustment before reuse.

Authenticated pages keep `RecordingStudio::UsesDefaultLayout`. Dummy overrides `layouts/recording_studio/default_layout` so `<html data-theme="rounded">` wraps those screens (index, kit show, Admin). That is Flatpack's built-in rounded theme from `flat_pack/variables`. Devise sign-in keeps `layouts/application`, which already has the same html attribute.

Dummy Tailwind must scan FlatPack components, Recording Studio's default layout, Admin, and this gem, or the host looks unstyled. `bin/rails tailwindcss:build` writes gem `@source` paths first. After changing views or gems, run that build (or `bin/dev`) so CSS is not an empty shell.
